        Adolf Hitler (1889 – 1945) was a German political leader, dictator, and the head of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (Nazi Party). Born in Braunau am Inn, Austria-Hungary, he moved to Germany in 1913 and served as a soldier during World War I.

After the war, Hitler became active in politics, rising to lead the Nazi Party. He gained power through propaganda, mass rallies, and promises to restore Germany’s strength after its defeat in WWI. In 1933, he was appointed Chancellor of Germany, and by 1934 he established a totalitarian dictatorship as Führer.

Hitler’s regime aggressively expanded German territory, starting World War II in 1939 with the invasion of Poland. His policies of racial hatred and antisemitism led to the Holocaust, in which six million Jews and millions of others were murdered.

As Allied forces closed in on Berlin, Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945, bringing an end to his rule. His leadership caused devastation across Europe and resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of people.
